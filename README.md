# Road Accident Analysis Dashboard
This project is an Excel-based dashboard designed to analyze road accident data. By examining trends, key performance indicators (KPIs), and road-type distributions, this dashboard provides valuable insights to identify patterns and support data-driven decision-making for improving road safety.

## Features

- **1. KPI Overview**: Displays key metrics such as the total number of casualties, highlighting critical performance indicators.
- [KPI( Key Performance Indicator)](https://github.com/Analysit-vaibhav/Excel-Road-Accident-Analysis/blob/ed409d0f1b5a036d3a08e019bb68c914131cd69a/KPI.pdf)
- **2. Monthly Trends**: Visualizes monthly trends of road accidents across multiple years (e.g., 2021 vs. 2022) to identify seasonal variations.
- [Casualties by Month](https://github.com/Analysit-vaibhav/Excel-Road-Accident-Analysis/blob/ed409d0f1b5a036d3a08e019bb68c914131cd69a/Monthly%20Trend.pdf)
- **3. Road Type Analysis**: Examines accident data by road types to determine where incidents are most frequent.
- [Casualties by Road Type](https://github.com/Analysit-vaibhav/Excel-Road-Accident-Analysis/blob/ed409d0f1b5a036d3a08e019bb68c914131cd69a/Road%20Type.pdf)
- **4. Tree Map Visualization**: A hierarchical representation of accident severity and frequency for better visual understanding.
- [Casualties by Road Surface](https://github.com/Analysit-vaibhav/Excel-Road-Accident-Analysis/blob/ed409d0f1b5a036d3a08e019bb68c914131cd69a/Tree%20Map.pdf)
- **5. Dynamic Charts**: Includes count charts and trends to explore accident statistics interactively.
- [Casualties by lighting Condition and Area](https://github.com/Analysit-vaibhav/Excel-Road-Accident-Analysis/blob/ed409d0f1b5a036d3a08e019bb68c914131cd69a/count%2Cdonat%20chart.pdf)
- **6. Interactive Dashboard**: Combines KPIs, trends, and visual charts to give a comprehensive view of the data.

- Number of casualties
- Accident severity
- Monthly and yearly trends
- Distribution across road types

## Sheets Included

1. **RAW DATA**: Contains the complete dataset for road accidents.
2. **Data Analysis Sheet**: Processed data and calculations for analysis.
3. **Dashboard**: Visual representation of key insights.
4. **KPI**: Key performance indicators summarizing the accident data.
5. **Monthly Trend**: Monthly trends comparing accidents across years.
6. **Road Type**: Insights into accident distribution by road types.
7. **Tree Map**: A hierarchical chart for severity and counts.
8. **Count Charts**: Charts summarizing counts of accidents.

## Usage

1. Download the Excel file and open it in Excel or a compatible spreadsheet tool.
2. Navigate through the various sheets to explore KPIs, trends, and visual charts.
3. Use the dashboard to analyze patterns, compare accident data across months/years, and identify key areas of concern.
